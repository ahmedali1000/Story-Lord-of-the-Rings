                <p class="para">The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,[a] who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took, but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men, Aragorn, a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior; Legolas Greenleaf, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a wizard.</p>

                    The story begins in the Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits the Ring from Bilbo Baggins, his cousin[c] and guardian. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's nature, but Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and an old friend of Bilbo, suspects it to be Sauron's Ring. Seventeen years later, after Gandalf confirms his guess, he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener, servant and friend, Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took. They are nearly caught by the Black Riders, but shake off their pursuers by cutting through the Old Forest. There they are aided by Tom Bombadil, a strange and merry fellow who lives with his wife Goldberry in the forest.</p>

Together, they leave Berry after another escape from the Black Riders. On the hill of Weathertop, they are attacked again by Black Riders, who wounded Frodo with a cursed blade.

Strider was revealed to be Aragon, the heir of Isilder. Gandalf reported that Saruman had betrayed them and was now working to become a force in itself. The Council decides that the ring must be destroyed, but this can only be done by sending it to the Fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it has been forged. Frodo takes this task on himself. Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses his companions. The ring company is nine in number: Frodo, Sam, Miri, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli Dwarf, Legolas, Elf, and Boromir's man, Denethor's son, Governor Steward of the land of Gondor.</p>
